Our mission was to clean the messy dataset known as “Shark Attacks” that we get [from this link](https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm) 

## Summary
This is the MVP that we are going to present to the customer.
We applied wrangling techquines (cleaning, )
We use Python and Pandas

## Dataset

- Shape of dataset before (format of dates, year, country, state)
- Transformations we applied:
  - Replace x with y
  - format dates with regex
  - format year
- final shape and relevant columns

## Issues

- No pattern in injuries
- Multiple date/year formats
- States are without pattern
- Missing values
- unnamed columns

## Solutions

- i
